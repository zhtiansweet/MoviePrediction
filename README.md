We tried to build a basic movie rating prediction system using usersâ€™ rating data. We gathered the data from user-rated movies, and estimated the scores they would rate for non-rated movies.

We wrote code on kNN by ourselves, and import SVD and Neighborhood SVD from [reces library](https://github.com/ocelma/python-recsys).
